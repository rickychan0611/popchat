          stipulates the terms and conditions under which DIGIPAL TECH INC. (hereafter
          referred to as &quot;AI Me&quot; or &quot;we&quot; or &quot;our&quot;)
          provides services on its website, including but not limited to the websites
          listed above. In this document, the terms &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;

        </p>
        <br /><p><strong>1. User Eligibility and Identity Verification</strong></p>
        
        <br /><p><strong>User Eligibility: </strong></p>
        <p>
          You must be at least eighteen (18) years of age to use this website unless the
          legal age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence is greater than
          eighteen years, in which case you must meet the legal age of majority in your
          area. Please note that this website is not to be used in areas where it is
          legally prohibited.
        </p>
        <br /><p><strong>Identity Verification:</strong></p>
        <p>
          To upload content on our website, all users must complete identity
          verification. During the verification process, you will need to provide the
          following two items:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A valid identification document with your photo.</li>
          <li>A photo of you holding that identification document near your face.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Users must provide clear, government-issued photo identification and a selfie
          with that ID. If users provide false information or attempt to circumvent our
          verification system, they will face consequences including permanent account
          suspension and prohibition from accessing the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          This verification applies to all users who wish to upload any content on the
          website (excluding profile pictures and background images). We reserve the
          right to request identity verification at any time based on any reason we deem
          necessary. Any content uploaded by the user will not be published on the
          website until the verification process is complete. Once account verification
          is successful, our review team will inspect the uploaded content and
          automatically publish it to the user's account upon confirming compliance with
          all relevant regulations.
        </p>

        </p>
        <br /><p><strong>7. Website Services Overview</strong></p>
        <br /><p><strong>Service Content: </strong></p>
        <p>
          We specialize in providing adult entertainment services, including live adult
          performances and other activities. For more detailed information about our
          services, please refer to the complete terms of service on our website or
          browse through the website content.
        </p>
        <p>
          We offer users a variety of interactive methods, which may be adjusted at our
          discretion. These include, but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Users can engage in real-time chats with other users and models while
            watching the model's video stream.
          </li>
          <li>Users can tip models using purchased tokens.</li>
          <li>
            Users can participate in group shows of models' video streams, chat with
            models and other users, with charges based on the rates published on the
            website and billed by time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users can watch a model's video stream in private and chat with the model,
            while other users may spy without participating in the interaction, also
            billed by time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users are allowed to spy on private shows between other users and models,
            billed by time.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We allow users to private message other users through the website's messaging
          system at no extra cost. Depending on their user level, users can privately
          message models and share content via the messaging system. Models can set
          token fees for receiving messages, payable per message sent regardless of
          whether a response is received. Users can also send pictures through the
          messaging system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users are responsible for all content sent via the messaging system and must
          ensure it complies with all relevant legal regulations and terms of service.
          We rely on users and models to report inappropriate content. If violations of
          the terms of service are discovered, we reserve the right to terminate the
          offending user's access to the website.
        </p>
        <br /><p><strong>Fees and Billing: </strong></p>
        <p>
          When participating in activities billed by the second or minute, users must
          actively exit to stop the billing. If the tokens are insufficient, users will
          not be able to continue participating in billed activities. We reserve the
          right to adjust pricing.
        </p>
        <p>
          All models and users can decide whether to participate in an activity and must
          comply with the website's terms of service and rules. If there is any dispute
          over a model's activity, users should resolve it directly with the model, and
          we do not assume responsibility for such disputes.
        </p>
        <br /><p><strong>8. Tokens and Payment</strong></p>
        <br /><p><strong>Purchasing Tokens: </strong></p>
        <p>
          You can buy tokens to tip your favourite models. Token prices may be adjusted
          during special promotional activities. Token purchases must be made using
          credit/debit cards or other available payment methods. All token purchases
          require upfront payment. Token prices will be displayed on the website and may
          be adjusted from time to time at our discretion, possibly due to special
          promotions or limited time offers. You must provide payment information
          including name, address, card number, expiration date, and security code when
          purchasing. You must ensure that the payment method used is legal and the
          provided payment information is accurate and valid.
        </p>
        <br /><p><strong>Payment Processing: </strong></p>
        <p>
          We may use third-party services to process or facilitate payments, and the
          information you provide to us may be shared with these third parties. We
          reserve the right at our discretion to refuse, cancel, or terminate your
          order, especially in cases where products or services are unavailable,
          descriptions or prices are incorrect, or there is an error in the order
          itself. When the auto-renewal feature is enabled, the system will
          automatically charge your account an amount equal to your last purchase when
          the tokens in your account fall below the set threshold. You can cancel this
          feature at any time in your account settings.
        </p>
        <br /><p><strong>Refund Policy: </strong></p>
        <p>
          If we terminate your usage rights for breach of terms, you will not be
          entitled to a refund for any unused tokens. In other cases, refunds will be
          processed according to the rules published on the website or the terms of the
          payment processing company. If tokens are incorrectly deducted due to website
          technical issues or unsatisfactory private performances (which must be
          terminated immediately), we may, at our discretion, issue a refund of tokens.
          However, tips given as gifts and tokens used to spy on others’ private shows
          are non-refundable.
        </p>
        <br /><p><strong>Inactive Accounts: </strong></p>
        <p>
          If your account is inactive for a long period (no use or token purchase), we
          reserve the right to terminate your use of the website at our discretion. In
          this case, you will forfeit any unused tokens, and these tokens are
          non-recoverable.
        </p>
        <p>
          By adhering to these terms, you agree to be responsible for the payment
          methods used on our website and not to falsely report unauthorized charges,
          lost, or stolen payment methods without justification. Violating this
          provision may result in an additional administrative fee of $100 payable to
          us, and this does not limit our right to demand further liabilities from you
          for any other reason.

        <br /><p><strong>9. Trust and Safety</strong></p>
        <br /><p><strong>Content Safety and Review Process: </strong></p>
        <p>
          We are committed to maintaining a healthy community environment by
          implementing strict content guidelines, verifying the identities of models,
          pre-screening messages, and proactively detecting and reporting non-compliant
          behaviours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our website only accepts content posted by registered and verified individuals
          and does not rely on third parties to collect consent for people depicted in
          the content, thus eliminating the distribution of non-consensual content.
        </p>
        <p>
          All pre-recorded content, including images and videos, undergoes an automatic
          and manual dual review process before publication to ensure legality,
          compliance with third-party industry standards, and our internal rules, and
          with the consent of the people depicted in the content.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a dedicated internal review team that monitors content submitted to
          the website around the clock, blocking the publication of illegal,
          non-compliant, and inappropriate content based on website rules and
          guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use Computer Vision (CV) technology to real-time tag potentially harmful
          live content and to verify the identity of models with obscured faces,
          ensuring the live broadcaster matches the identity verified at the time of
          account setup.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use automated systems to filter suspicious messages, with high-risk
          messages being held from display on the website until manual review.
        </p>
        <p>
          All third-party reports are investigated, and responses are prioritized based
          on the severity of the violation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We consistently and fairly enforce guidelines and terms, taking appropriate
          punitive measures based on the type of violation and its potential harm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users are encouraged to remain vigilant and report any content or behaviour
          that may violate community guidelines, model rules, studio rules, or terms of
          service. We have a reporting mechanism in place to facilitate immediate
          feedback when users identify issues.
        </p>
        <br /><p><strong>Special Attention for International Users: </strong></p>
        <p>
          Under the Digital Services Act (DSA), users located in the European Economic
          Area (EEA) can report illegal content or violations of terms through a
          specific link, ensuring compliance with regional legal regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are dedicated to creating a safe and respectful environment and appreciate
          the contributions of every user to uphold the high standards of our community.
        </p>
        <br /><p><strong>10. Recording Features and Regulations</strong></p>
        <br /><p><strong>Model Recording Settings: </strong></p>
        <p>
          Models can choose whether to allow users to record their performances in the
          account settings. Before each live session, models need to confirm whether
          this feature is activated. By enabling this feature, models agree to audio and
          video recordings of their performances by users and AI Me, and AI Me may use
          these recordings for news, promotions, advertisements, and other purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the model does not activate this feature, users must ensure that this live
          content is not shared outside the platform. If any user attempts to take
          screenshots or record videos of the content, their profile will be banned, and
          they will subsequently lose access to the website.
        </p>
        <br /><p><strong>Waiver of Rights and Release of Liability:</strong></p>
        <p>
          When models enable the recording feature, they waive all rights to payments or
          royalties related to these recordings (excluding any tokens that users may
          pay). Models also relinquish any right to review or approve any photos,
          videos, or audio taken by AI Me or users. Furthermore, models release AI Me,
          its employees, and all individuals involved in the recording, filming, or
          publishing processes from any liability in these activities.
        </p>
        <br /><p><strong>User Restrictions: </strong></p>
        <p>
          Users are only permitted to use recorded performances for personal
          entertainment purposes and are strictly prohibited from using them for
          commercial or other purposes. Users are forbidden from publishing, displaying,
          copying, or reproducing any recorded content. If users purchase any recorded
          content, they retain ownership of these materials even if the model’s account
          is deleted.

        <br /><p><strong>Safety and Content Monitoring: </strong></p>
        <p>
          We prioritize the safety of our recommendation system and take measures to
          prevent the recommendation of illegal or non-compliant content. Our internal
          team monitors content around the clock, using computer vision technology to
          tag potentially harmful content, ensuring the compliance of recommended
          content.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Special Note for Users in the European Economic Area (EEA): </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Users located in the EEA have the option to disable the recommendation system,
          which may impact the optimization of personalized experiences. Once disabled,
          recommendations will no longer be based on user location, language
          preferences, or interactions with models. The option to disable can be found
          at the bottom of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through these systems, we aim to help users discover new models and live
          broadcasts, enriching their browsing experience while ensuring content safety
          and appropriateness. We encourage users to actively report any inappropriate
          content to maintain the health and safety of the community.

        <p>
          Should any dispute arise between you and us, it will be resolved through

          or claims arising out of or relating to these terms and conditions, including

          providing a marketplace and does not participate in the actual transactions
          between users. Therefore, we are not responsible for any disputes, fraud, or

          terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or any other rights. If
          any part of these terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable under
