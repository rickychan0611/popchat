              The PopChat team greatly appreciates the work law enforcement and
              regulatory enforcement agencies do to keep people safe around the
              world. We work with Law Enforcement (“LE”) or Regulatory
              Enforcement (“RE”) and Requests for Information (“RFI”) as set
              out in more detail in our Law Enforcement Guide. As you would
              expect, we manage such requests confidentially.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              PopChat has created a Law Enforcement and Regulatory RFI Overview
              to guide on how to submit an RFI to secure relevant account holder
              or transactional information that PopChat may hold to facilitate
              greater ease and expedience.

            <p className="mb-4">
              PopChat honors formal requests from LE or RE authorities to
              preserve account information in accordance with relevant and
              applicable law. Upon receipt of a signed and dated preservation
              request letter from a LE agency, our Legal and Compliance
              Department ("L&C") will conduct a review of the request.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Once our L&C Department verifies the lawfulness of the request and
              that PopChat possesses the requested information, PopChat will
              preserve the requested information. PopChat will follow up with
              the LE and confirm the preservation of the requested information.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The information will be preserved for up to 90 days. It is the
              responsibility of the LE to obtain the requisite legal document on
              the back of the preservation request to facilitate the transfer of
              the information lawfully to the LE.

              PopChat strictly adheres to local data privacy/retention law in
              relevant jurisdictions. We will research and disclose
              information/data specified with particularity in an appropriate
              legal manner and reasonably able to locate and retrieve. We do not
              retain data for law enforcement purposes unless we receive a valid
              preservation request before a user has deleted that content from
              our service. Where these requests may conflict with local law
              related to data privacy/ retention, we will seek legal advice.

              Emergency Requests for Information (ERFI)
            </h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Emergency requests are characterized as those made by an LE to
              address an imminent threat/danger to individuals. PopChat is able
              under some circumstances to voluntarily disclose account-related
              information when we believe in good faith that an emergency poses
              a threat of imminent death or serious bodily injury to a person or
              persons and that the emergency situation would require the
              immediate disclosure of such information. To facilitate an
              emergency request please enclose an emergency disclosure request
              form along with the request.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Note: We will not review or respond to requests submitted by
              non-law enforcement officials. Users aware of an emergency should
              immediately and directly contact local law enforcement officials.

            <p className="mb-4">
              In instances where we are made aware of potential child
              exploitation content on our platform, our L&C will review the
              allegations and if appropriate report such situations to local LE.
              In addition, PopChat will take steps should allegations be found
              to shut down and expel bad users/streamers from our site in
              accordance with our community guidelines.

            <h3 className="mb-4">Notification to Users</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Our policy is to notify our users when we receive legal requests
              seeking the production of user records, information, or content.
              We recognize two exceptions to this policy. First, we will not
              notify users of legal requests where providing notice is
              prohibited by law or by other legal authorities. Second, where we
              in our sole discretion believe an exceptional circumstance exists
              — such as cases involving child exploitation or the threat of
              imminent death or bodily injury — we reserve the right to forgo
              user notice.

            <p className="mb-4">
              PopChat does not provide expert witness testimony. Data production
              made to LE will be accompanied by a signed Certificate of
              Authenticity which should eliminate the need for the testimony of
              a Custodian of Records in most jurisdictions.

              We may seek reimbursement for costs in responding to an RFI as
              provided by law. We may also charge additional fees for expenses
              incurred in responding to unusual or burdensome requests such as
              those requiring an expedited response. These fees apply on a
              per-request and per-account basis.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              PopChat at its sole discretion may waive these fees in matters
              investigating potential harm to children and our users and
              emergency requests.
