                  Trust and safety are our number one priority. We recommend
                  that all your interactions with new connections remain in the
                  app while getting to know someone. Users with bad intentions
                  often attempt to move the conversation off-platform right
                  away.

                We encourage everyone to follow our Community Guidelines and

              <p className="mb-4">
                You can permanently block a user at any time. This will prevent
                them from being able to contact you in any way.

              </ol>
              <p className="mt-4">
                When you block another user, they won't be notified that you
                blocked them. They won't be able to view your profile or
                interact with you through direct messages.

                  In addition to our Safety Tips, we advise that women take
                  extra precautions when using any online social app. While you
                  should feel empowered by PopChat as a social tool, you should
                  be cautious of how much information you share and proactively
                  avoid those who make you feel uncomfortable by blocking or
                  unfriending.
