            meaningful conversations. To support this aim we provide Products,
            (Apps and Services) as described below.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Enable you to connect and communicate with people and friends
              effectively. We help you connect and find people and friends
              across our platforms. We use the data we have to help make
              personalized relevant and meaningful connections and
              conversations. We use and have developed technologies and designed
              our systems so that your experience is consistent and seamless to
              help you connect and share, through live video, chat, text,
              sharing photos, interests, music, videos and conversation.

              analyzing data about our users and understanding how they use our
              Products. This includes developing advanced technologies such as

            <h2>10. Liability</h2>
            <p>
              10.1 We are not liable for any damages based on your use of the
              App or the Services, your ability to use the App or the Services
              or in any way or for any failures in the App or Services. Your
              access to and use of the Services and App or any content is at
              your own risk. You understand and agree that the Services are
              provided to you on an “As Is” and “As Available basis”.
            </p>
            <p>
              10.2 If we are liable for any event, this liability shall be
              limited to direct damages. This means that we are not liable for,
              among other things, any consequential, indirect or reputational
              damages, any loss, deletion, destruction or damage of or to your
              personal rights, your data, your personal data or your device.
            </p>
            <p>
              10.3 As some jurisdictions do not allow the enforcement of some of
              the exclusions or limitations set forth in these Terms, some of
              these exclusions or limitations may not apply to you. In such an
              event, our liability will be limited to the maximum extent
              possible under applicable law. Our liability for damages will
              never exceed the amount of 100USD per event. These limitations of
              liability also apply with respect to damages incurred by you by
              reason of any products or services sold or provided by third
              parties other than by us and received through or advertised on the
              App or any of the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              10.4 Any limitations of liability as set out above do not apply
              insofar as the damage has resulted from willful misconduct or
              gross negligence on our part.
            </p>

            <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
            <p>
              11.1 You hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us harmless,
              as well as our licensors, partners, and our respective affiliates,
              officers, directors, employees, contractors, and suppliers
              (individually and collectively), from and against any and all
              claims, actions, liability, damages, and costs, including
              reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred by such parties, in connection
              with or arising out of:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                a. your violation or breach of any term of these Terms or any
                applicable law or regulation, whether or not referenced herein;
              </li>
              <li>b. your violation of any rights of any third party;</li>
              <li>c. your use or misuse of the Products; or</li>
              <li>
                d. your Content or other communication displayed or transmitted
                by means of the Products.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              11.2 The above indemnification applies even if a court, an
              administrative agency, or any other dispute resolving or
              investigating body decides we shall be held liable and/or imposes
              sanctions on us.
            </p>
            <p>
              11.3 If you downloaded the App from the Application Stores, you
              acknowledge that, if there is a claim by any third party that the

              intellectual property rights, only we are responsible for the
              investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of such claim.
              We can exclusively defend and control any matter for which you
              indemnify us, at your expense. You agree to cooperate with our
              defense of these claims, and you will not settle any matter
              without our prior written consent.
            </p>

              that any of the foregoing will be corrected. We do not warrant or
              make any representations regarding the use of, or the results from

              between you and us, and that the warranty disclaimers and the
              limitations of liability set forth herein form an essential basis
              of the bargain between you and us. We would not be able to provide
              the Products to you on an economically reasonable basis without
              these limitations.
            </p>

              effective only if in writing and signed by us.
            </p>

              provisions shall apply irrespective of the choice of Canada law.
