        <li>
          Identity data, where if the studio operator is a corporate entity, we regularly collect information about its
          associated persons and ultimate beneficiaries. If the studio operator is an individual, we may process personal
          information voluntarily provided in their account. Additionally, we collect and use aggregated data, such as
          demographic information, to support our marketing activities. Although this aggregated data is derived from your
          personal data, it does not directly or indirectly identify you and thus is not considered personal data. For
          example, we may analyse usage data to calculate the proportion of access to specific features or the display and
          click-through rates of advertisements and publish statistical and demographic information based on this data. If
          such aggregated data is combined or linked with personal data in a way that could directly or indirectly
          identify
          you, it will be treated as personal data in accordance with the provisions of this privacy policy.

        requirements, or where we have contractual or statutory rights, we may disclose your personal data or information
        related to your use of the website services to third parties. When disclosing personal data to service providers,
        we
        ensure through contractual agreements that they comply with GDPR and other relevant legal obligations. Therefore,
        the recipients of personal data may include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Members of our corporate group, including those operating partner websites, use your data only to the extent
          necessary to fulfil the purposes described in this privacy policy, ensuring you have access to certain features.

          fulfilment, credit card payment processing, risk and fraud prevention, customer support, business and sales
          analysis, content customization, and website functionality support. These services also include support for

          personal data to provide these services, they are prohibited from using the data for other purposes or sharing
          it
          with others.
        </li>
        <li>Government and regulatory authorities, including law enforcement agencies, may need to contact us as part of
          their inquiries, procedures, or investigations, or to ensure that the company complies with legal and regulatory
          requirements. We specifically reserve the right to disclose all relevant information to law enforcement
          agencies,
          when necessary, whether due to suspected criminal activity, lawful criminal, civil, or administrative
          proceedings,
          investigative demands, subpoenas, court orders, or legal warrants, or to enforce our terms of use, including
          investigating potential violations. This also includes actions taken to detect, prevent, or address security or
          technical issues, protect the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others,
          or
          to maintain the security and integrity of our website and its infrastructure. In these instances, we may decide
          at
          our discretion whether to raise or waive any legal objections or rights.
        </li>
        <li>In the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all
          our
          assets, whether as part of normal operations or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar procedure, your
          personal data (including information related to members, visitors, models, and studio operators) may be
          transferred as one of the assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will endeavour to ensure that the
          entity receiving the data uses your personal data in a manner consistent with this privacy policy.
        </li>
        <li>Legal or other professional advisors, we may also disclose aggregated information about users and data that
          does not contain any personal data without restriction. These aggregated data may be shared with third parties
          for
          general business analysis, helping to develop new content and services, and for optimizing advertising. Please
          note that we have never and will never sell your personal data to any third party.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br/><h2>5. Publicly Displayed Personal Profiles </h2>
      <p>Members and models should be aware that the account information you create on the website is public, meaning it
        is
        visible to all members and visitors. Unless otherwise stated, even if the personal profiles of members or models
        do
        not contain personal information, others may still be able to identify you through other information in the
        profiles. Therefore, members and models should understand that you have full control over the information you post
        on the website and display in your personal profiles, and you are responsible for any consequences that may arise
        from such information.</p>
      <br/><h2>6. User-Submitted Content </h2>
      <p>Our website provides certain areas where, in compliance with the website's terms of use, you are allowed to
        submit
        or post information about yourself and others, communicate with others, post comments, and upload media content
        such
        as images, videos, and audio. You should be aware that any personal information you submit, display, or publish in
        forums, blogs, communities, or through other social features provided by our website is considered public
        information and may therefore be read, collected, and disclosed by us and third parties. Furthermore, the content
        you post may also appear on other websites or in related searches. Please note that we cannot control who may read
        your content or how other users may use the information you voluntarily post, so we advise you to exercise caution
        when submitting personal information. Once information is submitted or posted, you may not be able to edit or
        delete
        it. If you wish to remove your personal information that you have submitted or posted, please contact us at
        <a href="aime@.aimeai.live">aime@.aimeai.live</a>. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal
        information, and if this occurs,
        we will
        explain why it cannot be removed.</p>
      <br/><h2>
        7. Security of Your Personal Data
      </h2>
      <p>We have implemented appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards) to
        ensure the protection of your personal data from unauthorized access or disclosure. Only authorized employees who
        have a business need to know may access personal data. We also use encryption technology to transmit personal data
        between your system and ours to prevent unauthorized access. However, please be aware that no security risks
        associated with data storage and transmission can be completely eliminated, and we cannot guarantee that these
        security measures will completely prevent illegal access by third-party hackers. You are also responsible for
        keeping your unique passwords and account information confidential. We are not responsible for any actions that
        bypass the privacy settings or security measures on our website.</p>
      <br/><h2>
        8. Retention Period for Personal Data
      </h2>
      <p>
        We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, including
        meeting any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Should we encounter complaints or believe that there
        might
        be potential legal actions in the future, we may retain your personal data for a longer period, the duration of
        which will depend on the specific case. Once your personal data is no longer needed for the purposes described in
        this privacy policy, we will delete it from our systems. However, if we are unable to delete your data due to
        legal,
        regulatory, or technical reasons, we may need to retain it for a longer period, during which we will ensure that
        your privacy is protected.
      </p>
      <br/><h2>9. Cross-Border Data Transfers </h2>
      <p>When we collaborate with third parties located outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), processing your
        personal data may involve cross-border transfers. To ensure that personal data transferred outside the EEA
        receives
        adequate protection, we implement at least one of the following safeguards:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We only transfer personal data to countries that the European Commission has deemed to provide an adequate
          level
          of data protection.
        </li>
        <li>When using service providers located outside the EEA, we may employ specific contracts approved by the
          European
          Commission that ensure personal data receives the same protection as it does within the EU.
        </li>
        <li>When using service providers based in the United States, if they participate in the EU-US Privacy Shield
          framework, we may also transfer data to them, as this framework requires them to provide protection like that in
          the EU.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additionally, in very limited circumstances, if we have obtained your explicit consent beforehand or if the
        transfer is necessary to provide you with services, we may transfer data to other regions outside the EEA.</p>
      <br/><h2>
        10. Managing Your Personal Data
      </h2>
      <p>
        We are committed to ensuring the security of your data and want you to be informed about the types of information
        we
        collect so you can make privacy choices. You can manage your personal data in the following ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can review or change the personal information you provided at registration.</li>
        <li>You can set the visibility of your profile or uploaded content to be open to everyone, only to members and/or
          models, or just to your friends.
        </li>
        <li>If you are a model, you can also set the visibility of your uploaded photos, videos, and albums to be open to
          everyone, only to members and/or models, or just to your friends.
        </li>
        <li>You can control who sees your information through social networks, comments, and the website’s private
          messaging feature.
        </li>
        <li>You can also manage cookies, including those related to our services, by enabling or disabling them on your

        11. Marketing Information

        14. California Consumer Privacy Act Notice
      </h2>
      <p>Since January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) provides California residents
        (“consumers”) with specific rights regarding their personal information as defined by the CCPA. In addition to the
        rights stated in our policy and the exceptions under the CCPA, consumers have the following rights:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information if we sell their personal information.</li>
        <li>The right to be informed about the specific details of how we collect and use their personal information.</li>
        <li>The right to request the deletion of specific personal information we have collected from them.</li>
        <li>The right to designate an agent to exercise their rights under the CCPA, provided that a formally executed
          power of attorney is given, and the agent possesses information deemed sufficient to allow us to verify the
          relevant consumer's identity and locate their information in our system.
        </li>
        <li>The right to non-discrimination in exercising these rights. We pledge not to discriminate against California
          residents for exercising their rights under the CCPA, nor will we provide a different level or quality of
          services
          to them, unless explicitly permitted by the CCPA.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This website has never sold personal information to third parties for money or other valuable considerations.
        However, to provide specific services and ensure the proper functioning of the website, we may need to share some
        personal information with third parties, service providers, and other entities within our corporate group.
        Nevertheless, we still respect the right of California residents to opt out of such sharing arrangements and
        prevent
        their personal information from being sold in the future. If the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) applies to
        you and you wish to register such preferences, please email us at <a href="aime@.aimeai.live">aime@.aimeai.live</a>.
