            out below.
          </p>

          <h3>2.1 “Registration and Account Data”</h3>
          <p>
            When you install the Service on your device and/or register for an
            account with PopChat, personally and/or non-personally identifiable
            information about you may be collected. There are two types of
            Registration and Account Data.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Information you provide (mandatory)</strong> - You will be
              asked to provide your gender, name or an alias and date of birth
              together with your mobile phone or email address. This is
              important to help us provide you with the connection and friends
              features in our Service.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Information you provide (optional)</strong> - You may also
              choose to provide other personally identifiable information such
              as your photos or videos of yourself, description of yourself and
              information about your interests. For example, you can indicate
              your interests in your profile page. The provision of such
              information is entirely optional. If you register and log in using
              your Facebook, Apple or Google account, we may also collect
              additional information that you make available to us. For example,
              if you register with PopChat using your Facebook account (e.g.
              Facebook Connect), we may collect and store your Facebook ID and
              corresponding token on our servers for automatic log in and
              profile information and, if you give us your express consent, we
              will have access to and may collect certain information that you
              make available on Facebook (for example, your first and last
              names, email address, profile picture, birthdays). We will store
              it on our servers and use it to facilitate your use of the Service
              – for example - we may synchronize your PopChat account between
              different devices which you may use to access our Service.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We also use your contact information to market to you as your
            country’s laws allow – for example if there are new offerings for
            our Services or updates regarding changes to our Services and to
            help others find your account if your settings permit, including
            through third-party services and client applications. You can use
            your settings for email and mobile notifications to control
            notifications you receive from us. You can also unsubscribe from a
            notification by following the instructions contained within the
            notification or <a href="#">here</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the video calling features, you can use our personal
            text messaging service as part of the Services in the App. When you
            communicate with others by sending or receiving text messages, we
            will store and process your communications and information related
            to them. This includes scanning for malicious content, detection of
            abuse and prohibited images, and use of reported issues. We also use
            information about whom you have communicated with and when (but not
            the content of those communications) to better understand the use of
            our Services, to protect the safety and integrity of our platform.

            that browser or device with your account for purposes such as
            authentication, security, and personalization. Subject to your
            settings, we may also associate your account with browsers or
            devices other than those you use to log into PopChat (or associate
            your logged-out device or browser with other browsers or devices).
            When you provide other information to PopChat, including an email
            address, we associate that information with your PopChat account.
            Subject to your settings, we may also use this information in order
            to infer other information about your identity, for example by
            associating your account with hashes of email addresses that share
            common components with the email address you have provided to
            PopChat. We do this to operate and personalize our Services. For
            example, if you log in through Facebook, we connect with your age
            profile there to help maintain the required standards to be on our
            App and use the Services.

            profile picture, date of birth, email, gender, Facebook ID if you
            have logged into your account on the App using your Facebook
