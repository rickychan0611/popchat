            <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">Facebook and Google login</h4>
            <p className="mb-4">
              If you believe someone has gained access with your Facebook or Google account, we recommend you update your Facebook and Google passwords immediately or visit 
              <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/hacked">Facebook's Help Centre</a> or 
              <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6294825?hl=en">Google's Account Help</a> for direct support.

            <h4 className="font-bold mb-2">Contact Us</h4>

              Contact us and describe your issue as detailed as possible so we can provide you with the support you need.

            <h3 className="mb-4">Protect your Account</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Never share your username and password with third parties. Pick a strong password and be cautious when connecting from shared or public devices. A strong password typically ranges between 8 to 16 characters in length. Randomness is critical in password strength. Remember, never include personal identifiable information in your password.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Our Apps will never send you an email requesting your username and password information â€” if you receive an email asking for account information, report it as soon as possible.

            <p className="mb-4">
              While we rely on automated technologies and human review to prevent abusive behavior on the platform, we won't be reviewing your private interactions with other users unless in very limited cases and when we have a very strong reason to do so.
